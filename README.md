# CSE_587_Midterm_Project
In this project we did sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, classifying a movie review as positive or negative. We have used Glove and Word2Vec embeddings and used different deep learning models to classify the reviews.

# Running the code
First finish the data preprocessing with Glove or Word2Vec and generate pickle files.
Update the pkl file paths in the model that you want to run and run it
Note: 
1. All the files are ran in colab by mounting the google drive, so change paths accordingly.
2. Data is automatically downloaded from Hugging face IMDB dataset.
